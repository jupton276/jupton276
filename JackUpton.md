Hi, my name's Jack, I've been taking classes at WCC for a few years. 
I'm working on an associates in general math/science, as well as a certificate in Java. My plan is to go to MSU next year and study data science.
In my free time I like to play video games and mess around on my piano and guitar.
I look forward to working with you all!
